\section{Equation}
The standard deviation function, $\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N(a_i - \mu)^2}$
\section{Description:}
			Determines the variation in a set of data, where $\mu$ is the mean, and $x_i$ is the data at the given index $i$, and $N$ is the number of data. To find it, you calculate the sum from 1 to $N$ of $(a_i - \mu)$, then square it. After that, you simply divide by the number of data, and take the square root of it.
